The wet leaves drip
On the wet brown wall.
The wet sky hangs
Above it all.
The daffodils
Bow down their heads.
The tulips lie down
In their beds. 
But Spring smells fresh
In the new-washed air,
And robins hip-hop
Everywhere.
There underneath
The apple tree
The petals make
A wide pink sea.
In puddles deep
As fairy moats
The beetles sail
In flower boats.
